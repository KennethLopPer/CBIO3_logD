# CBIO3_logD
This repository includes the jupyter notebook and necessary files for the prediction of logD at different pH values. 
Different functions are created for the prediction of logPN, logPI and pKa. Also, it includes a function that integrate these three values into predicting the logD using the relation they have in the Handerson-Hasselbach equation. 

The use of the scripts requires previous installation of rdkit module.
